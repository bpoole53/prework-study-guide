# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this project to learn the basics of coding, more specifically web development.  Building this project taught me what I will need to know to start on my path to becoming a developer.  There is a lot about this topic that I do not know and this was a way for me to cultivate knowledge and develop my skills to be able to reach my goals.  I learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and so much more that will help guide me on this journey that I am about to begin.
